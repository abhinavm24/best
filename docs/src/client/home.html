		<h4>Easy to Write</h4>
		<p>Benchmarks are easy to write with a simple set of primitives so you don't have to worry about any domain specific knowledge.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card card-shade">
		<h4>Anywhere and Anytime</h4>
		<p>You can run, compare, and diff any change both locally and on dedicated hardward. This lets you compare any versions you want in whichever browser you desire.</p>

	<div class="card card-shade">
		<h4>Simple Automation</h4>
		<p>Best allows you to setup one set of dedicated machines so that no teams have to maintain any of their own infastructure.</p>

		<h3>Getting Started with Best</h3>
		<p>Best allows you to write benchmarks in the same way you write unit tests. This allows you to integrate Best into your CI workflow to create a consistent picture of your code's performance over time. Ready to jump in? Check out the Developer Guide to read about how to get started!</p>

			<h4>Reproducible Results</h4>
			<p>Best is designed to run on dedicated hardware, this means that you are running your benchmarks in the same environment everytime. We encourage you do this so that your results are not effected by an inconsistent environment which can be a false flag for performance changes.</p>
			<p>The Best Hub and Agent model works great for implemeneting this, if you want to learn more take a look at <a href="/guide/running-remotely">Setting Up a Best Hub</a>.</p>

			<h4>Expressive Metrics</h4>
			<p>Best comes packed with ability to measure all the types of metrics you might want to know. You can learn more about the following metrics <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>aggregate</code>: The total time your benchmark took to run.</li>
				<li><code>script</code>: The time it took to evaluate your benchmark code.</li>
				<li><code>paint</code>: If you benchmark involves the DOM, we can measure how much time the browser spent on painting.</li>
				<li><code>layout</code>: If you benchmark involves the DOM, we can measure how much time the browser spent on layouts.</li>
